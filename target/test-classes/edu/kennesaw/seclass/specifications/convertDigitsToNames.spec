  null. [error]
  #For the empty case I feel like there will be a lot of unhandled exception so I did not constrain the other inputs relative to it]
  empty. [property empty]
  #I made the int max a single simply to constrain the domain. Technically for full coverage you would want to test it with others.
  int max. [single]

Number of numbers in the string:
  None. [if !empty]
  1. [if !empty]
  2. [if !empty]
  #I feel like if we can find two we can find more
  #you would want to test a really long string to try to overflow internal counters but that string would be tedious to generate.

Parameters:
#startPosition
startPosition value:
  <1.[error]
  1.
  >1.

#endposition
endPosition value:
  <startPosition. [error]
  =startPosition. [error]
